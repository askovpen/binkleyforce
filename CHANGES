* New: new command line option "-c" in the "bfstat" utility

* Bugfix: some file names could be spoiled on the Hydra protocol while
  receiving (it is a bug with receiving files with the name "d" instead
  of the real one)
* New: implementation of the YooHoo handshake protocol
* New: now will create .csy locks while dialing and convert it to
  the .bsy only at handshake
* Bugfix: now daemon will not call to the nodes marked as Hold/Down
  in a nodelist
* New: added sessions history loging. New config keyword "sessions_history"
  For the history file format look sources.

* New: passwords are case insensitive now (again)
* New: improved EMSI handshake, now it should work better with systems
  using Cisco or something like that with login prompt

  this feature added new option "[No]Intro"
* New: protocol selection options now works at incoming sessions too
* New: added support for modem chat commands, e.g "ATz| ATm0|", mailer
  will wait for modem response ("OK" or "ERROR") after sending each
  substring and only then send the next one
* Bugfix: file masks checker didn't work correctly than '!' (not)
  prefix was used. Now "DelayFiles", "SkipFiles" should work normaly

* Bugfix: daemon could call even to "-Unpublished-" phone if it was

* New: added support for Tx/Rx windows and ASC/UUE packets in the Hydra
* Bugfix: files skipped by remote mailer was not really skipped :)
* New: extended algorithm of renaming received file if file with such name
  allready exist in the inbound directory:
  - For netmail packets and '.tic' files: generate new random name
  - For arcmail packets: rotate extension characters, as most other mailers do
  - For file requests: allways overwrite existing file 
  - For all other files: add numeric extension as in previous versions
* New: added ability to recode file names and intro text to another charset
  then sending/receiving. Recode tables are compartible with HPT. New
  config keywords: "Recode_file_in", "Recode_file_out", "Recode_intro_in"
